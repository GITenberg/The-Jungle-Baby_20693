</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="figleft"><img src="images/image_t.jpg" alt="T" width="55" height="50" /></div>
<p class="p1">here was once a little white baby boy called Bab-ba, he had
bright blue eyes and golden curls, and he had a black Ayah
for his nurse. She had been with Bab-ba ever since he was
quite a tiny baby in long robes, and she was very fond of
him. Her name was Jeejee-walla, but they just called her
Ayah.</p>
<div class="figleft"><img src="images/image_b.jpg" alt="B" width="42" height="50" /></div>
<p class="p1">ab-ba&rsquo;s Father was an English Officer in India, and they
lived in a beautiful white house on the Simla Hills, with a
big verandah running all around it. Round about the verandah
was a garden, and outside the garden the jungle stretched
for miles and miles, and in the jungle were all sorts of
beasts and birds.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/image_04.jpg" width="500" height="794" alt="Illustration" />
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="figleft"><img src="images/image_l.jpg" alt="L" width="43" height="50" /></div>
<p class="p1">ittle Bab-ba used to play on the verandah with his pets,
Mioux-Mioux, the cat, and Wooff-Wooff, the dog, and they
both loved him very dearly. Mioux-Mioux never scratched him
when he accidentally pulled her tail, although she felt very
much like doing so; and Wooff-Wooff used to stand on his
hind legs and perform all sorts of funny tricks to make
Bab-ba laugh.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/image_05.jpg" width="500" height="719" alt="Illustration" />
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="figleft"><img src="images/image_e.jpg" alt="E" width="44" height="50" /></div>
<p class="p1">very morning after breakfast Bab-ba threw bread crumbs out
to the little birds on the lawn, and they used to sit in the
trees and watch for him, and sing about him till he came out
of the house. &ldquo;Good little Bab-ba, who gives us our food,&rdquo;
one would sing; and &ldquo;We all love little Bab-ba,&rdquo; several of
the others would reply from another part of the garden.</p>

<p class="p1">Mioux-Mioux used to watch them out of the corner of her
eyes, but she never attempted to catch them because she knew
that Bab-ba loved them; and Wooff-Wooff used to sit with his
head on one side and wonder however they managed with only
two legs and not four like his.</p>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/image_b.jpg" alt="B" width="42" height="50" /></div>
<p class="p1">ut one day when Bab-ba was feeding the birdies, the big
snake Hoodo, who lived in the garden, came creeping under
the verandah and tried to catch some of the birds while they
were eating, but Bab-ba saw him and called out!&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="p1">&ldquo;Go away, bad Hoodo, go away!&rdquo;</p></div>

<p class="p1">and his Ayah heard him and came running out to see what was
the matter.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/image_06.jpg" width="500" height="735" alt="Illustration" />
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="figleft"><img src="images/image_w.jpg" alt="W" width="65" height="50" /></div>
<p class="p1">hen she saw Hoodo, the big snake, she caught Bab-ba up in
her arms and ran with him into the house, and two of the men
servants came out with big sticks and beat Hoodo over the
head and body till he could hardly crawl away again into his
hole under a big tree in the garden.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/image_07.jpg" width="500" height="856" alt="Illustration" />
</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="figleft"><img src="images/image_n.jpg" alt="N" width="56" height="50" /></div>

<p class="p1">ow Hoodo was a very wicked snake, and was very angry about
all this, and he thought and thought about it, and wondered
how he could be revenged on little Bab-ba, for he put all
that had occurred down to him, and so one day, after he had
got better he went out into the jungle to see an old friend
of his, Tig, the Tiger, and talk the matter over with him.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/image_08.jpg" width="500" height="800" alt="Illustration" />
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="figleft"><img src="images/image_h.jpg" alt="H" width="54" height="50" /></div>
<p class="p1">oodo thought that Tig the Tiger was as greedy and cruel as
he was himself, and so he asked him how he would like a
little white fat baby boy for his dinner, and Tig licked his
lips and said, &ldquo;H&rsquo;M! we shall see.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/image_09.jpg" width="500" height="796" alt="Illustration" />
</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="figleft"><img src="images/image_t.jpg" alt="T" width="55" height="50" /></div>

<p class="p1">hen Hoodo went further into the jungle and met Prowl, the
Wolf.</p>


<p class="p1">&ldquo;How would you like a little fat white baby to eat?&rdquo; asked
Hoodo; and Prowl, the Wolf, licked his lips and said, &ldquo;Ha!&rdquo;
and nothing else.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/image_10.jpg" width="500" height="855" alt="Illustration" />
</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="figleft"><img src="images/image_a.jpg" alt="A" width="51" height="50" /></div>
<p class="p1">&nbsp;little further on Hoodo met Bluf, the big brown Bear, and
he asked him what he would do if he met a little fat white
baby in the jungle.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/image_11.jpg" width="500" height="768" alt="Illustration" />
</div>

<p class="p1">And Bluf stood up on his hind legs, hugged himself and said,
&ldquo;Ough! Very nice, very nice indeed!&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/image_a.jpg" alt="A" width="51" height="50" /></div>
<p class="p1">nd then Poon-dah, the big wild Elephant, came crushing
through the jungle, and Hoodo had to scurry out of his way,
so that he didn&rsquo;t get trampled upon.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/image_12.jpg" width="500" height="747" alt="Illustration" />
</div>

<p class="p1">&ldquo;How would you like a little white &mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he screamed out,
but Poon-dah made a loud noise with his trunk and went on,
for he didn&rsquo;t converse with snakes.</p>

<p class="p1">Nevertheless, Hoodo was satisfied, for he said, &ldquo;If Poon-dah
would trample on me in passing, so he would on a little
white baby if he were here;&rdquo; and his wicked black beady eyes
were bright and he laughed maliciously.</p>


<div class="figleft"><img src="images/image_a.jpg" alt="A" width="51" height="50" /></div>

<p class="p1">fter this Hoodo went home to his hole under the tree in
Bab-ba&rsquo;s Father&rsquo;s garden, and watched and waited till Bab-ba
should be quite by himself; and one day when Wooff-Wooff had
gone off after a wild rabbit, and Mioux-Mioux was fast asleep
in the sun, the Ayah went into the house to fetch Bab-ba&rsquo;s
Noah&rsquo;s ark, and he was left alone on the verandah.</p>

<p class="p1">Then Hoodo came sliding out of his hole very quickly and
stood before the verandah, waving his head backwards and
forwards, and shooting out his little tongue, while the sun
showed all the colours of the rainbow on his smooth shiny
skin.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/image_13.jpg" width="500" height="847" alt="Illustration" />
</div>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="figleft"><img src="images/image_o.jpg" alt="O" width="61" height="50" /></div>
<p class="p1">h, pretty Hoodo!&rdquo; said Bab-ba, &ldquo;but you&rsquo;re naughty. Go
away!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p1">&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Hoodo sweetly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not naughty, dear Bab-ba, and
I know where some such beautiful flowers grow. Come with me
and I&rsquo;ll show you!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p1">&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Bab-ba, shaking his head; but Hoodo continued to
look at him steadily, and presently Bab-ba slid down from
the verandah and came towards him.</p>

<p class="p1">Then Hoodo laughed and drew back quickly into the thick part
of the garden, with Bab-ba running after him.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/image_14.jpg" width="500" height="751" alt="Illustration" />
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="figleft"><img src="images/image_w.jpg" alt="W" width="65" height="50" /></div>
<p class="p1">hen the Ayah returned to the verandah with Bab-ba&rsquo;s Noah&rsquo;s
Ark, and she saw his little empty chair and Mioux-Mioux asleep
in the sun, she grew alarmed and ran about calling Bab-ba&rsquo;s
name, and wringing her hands, and Bab-ba&rsquo;s Mother came out,
and his Father, and they and all the servants hunted about in
the garden for a very long while, but could not find any trace
of him, and Mioux-Mioux woke up and wondered what all the
commotion was about, and Wooff-Wooff came back without the
rabbit and wondered too.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/image_15.jpg" width="500" height="839" alt="Illustration" />
</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="figleft"><img src="images/image_w.jpg" alt="W" width="65" height="50" /></div>

<p class="p1">ooff-Wooff went over to where Mioux-Mioux was sitting, and
talked the matter over with her. While they were talking,
some little birds overhead called out to them to attract
their attention.</p>

<p class="p1">&ldquo;Bab-ba,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;Bab-ba has followed Hoodo, the Snake,
into the jungle, and he will be lost and eaten by the wild
beasts unless he is brought back. Quick! Quick! Go after
him! Haste!&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 480px;"><span class="figcenter" style="width: 480px;"><img src="images/image_16.jpg" width="480" height="791" alt="Illustration" /></span></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="figleft"><img src="images/image_a.jpg" alt="A" width="51" height="50" /></div>

<p class="p1">nd so Wooff-Wooff ran to Bab-ba&rsquo;s Father and Mother and
tried to tell them.</p>

<p class="p1">He ran backwards and forwards towards the jungle, and barked
and tried to make them follow; but they wouldn&rsquo;t understand,
and so at last he had to set out himself to try and find
him.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/image_17.jpg" width="500" height="720" alt="Illustration" />
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="figleft"><img src="images/image_n.jpg" alt="N" width="56" height="50" /></div>

<p class="p1">ow after Bab-ba had followed Hoodo a little way through the
garden, the snake turned to a little path which led to a
hole broken in the wall.</p>

<p class="p1">&ldquo;You must crawl through here,&rdquo; said Hoodo, &ldquo;the pretty
flowers are on the other side.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p1">So Bab-ba crawled through and found himself in the jungle.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/image_18.jpg" width="500" height="818" alt="Illustration" />
</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="figleft"><img src="images/image_f.jpg" alt="F" width="56" height="49" /></div>

<p class="p1">urther on! further on!&rdquo; cried Hoodo, every time Bab-ba
stopped to gather any, &ldquo;there are prettier ones further on.&rdquo;
And so Bab-ba went on and on till he came to where Tig the
Tiger lay asleep in the long grass.</p>

<p class="p1">&ldquo;Now&rsquo;s your time,&rdquo; whispered Hoodo in his ear, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s the
little white baby for your dinner.&rdquo; And Tig sprang up with a
roar.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><span class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><img src="images/image_19.jpg" width="500" height="833" alt="Illustration" /></span></div>

<p class="p1">But Bab-ba wasn&rsquo;t a bit frightened, and he only laughed, and
said &ldquo;what a big, big Mioux-Mioux!&rdquo; And he put his arms
around Tig&rsquo;s neck and nestled his head in his soft fur, till
Tig forgot all about his dinner, and purred with delight
just like Mioux-Mioux did when she was pleased.</p>



<div class="figcenter" style="width: 480px;">
<img src="images/image_20.jpg" width="480" height="764" alt="Illustration" />
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="figleft"><img src="images/image_h.jpg" alt="H" width="54" height="50" /></div>
<p class="p1">oodo was very angry at this, and finding that Tig was
making friends with Bab-ba instead of eating him up, he
called Bab-ba to him and said, &ldquo;Come, let us be going, or we
shall be late home.&rdquo; And Bab-ba kissed Tig, the Tiger, and
followed Hoodo further into the jungle, till they met Prowl,
the Wolf. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the little white baby,&rdquo; whispered Hoodo.
And Prowl said, &ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; and was going to spring upon him and
eat him up. But Bab-ba only laughed and said, &ldquo;What a big
Wooff-Wooff!&rdquo; and patted him on the head, and looked into
his eyes so that Prowl forgot all about eating him, and
licked his hands and frisked about him just as Wooff-Wooff
would have done.</p>


<div class="figleft"><img src="images/image_t1.jpg" alt="T" width="65" height="48" /></div>

<p class="p1">his is silly,&rdquo; said Hoodo angrily. &ldquo;Come away, it is near to
sunset, and we must be getting home,&rdquo; and he led the way to
where Bluf, the big brown Bear, lived. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve brought the
little white baby for you,&rdquo; said Hoodo. And Bluf said, &ldquo;Ough!
very nice, very nice indeed!&rdquo; And caught Bab-ba up in his arms
and hugged him.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 480px;"><span class="figcenter" style="width: 480px;"><img src="images/image_21.jpg" width="480" height="831" alt="Illustration" /></span></div>

<p class="p1">&ldquo;Just like my Ayah does!&rdquo; laughed Bab-ba, and he patted
Bluf&rsquo;s cheeks and kissed him, so that Bluf didn&rsquo;t want to
eat him at all, but only to hug him and keep him warm.</p>




<div class="figleft"><img src="images/image_j.jpg" alt="J" width="33" height="50" /></div>

<p class="p1">ust then there was a loud trumpeting heard, and Bluf put
Bab-ba down to the ground, and Hoodo slid off into the grass,
hissing. &ldquo;Now Poon-dah is coming and you will be trampled to
death. Good-bye, little Bab-ba, I hate you!&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 480px;">
<img src="images/image_22.jpg" width="480" height="657" alt="Illustration" />
</div>

<p class="p1">But when Poon-dah came and saw the little white baby, he
remembered that he had not always been a wild elephant, but
had once himself belonged to a white man, and so he picked
little Bab-ba up with his trunk and placed him gently on his
back.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 480px;">
<img src="images/image_23.jpg" width="480" height="769" alt="Illustration" />
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="figleft"><img src="images/image_a.jpg" alt="A" width="51" height="50" /></div>
<p class="p1">nd that&rsquo;s the position in which Bab-ba&rsquo;s Father found him,
when at last he had understood Wooff-Wooff&rsquo;s barking, and
had followed him into the jungle, accompanied by some native
servants armed with guns and sticks. Wooff-Wooff traced the
little boy by his scent, till they came upon him riding on
Poon-dah&rsquo;s back.</p>

<p class="p1">And now a funny thing happened, for amongst the servants was
one who had once been Poon-dah&rsquo;s keeper, and Poon-dah remembered
him and allowed himself to be led by him to Bab-ba&rsquo;s home. And
so they returned in triumph with Bab-ba and his Father on
Poon-dah&rsquo;s back, and good Wooff-Wooff barking and frisking by
his side.</p>


<div class="figleft"><img src="images/image_t.jpg" alt="T" width="55" height="50" /></div>

<p class="p1">he wicked Hoodo was justly punished, for just as he was
going into his hole under the tree, he met an old enemy of
his, Tiv, the Mongoose, and the two fought and fought for a
long while, till at last Hoodo was exhausted and stretched
himself out and died, while little Tiv sat up and rubbed his
paws together to clean them, and then skipped off to his new
little home under Bab-ba&rsquo;s verandah, where he still lives to
keep away any other wicked snakes from harming him.</p>

the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with

opportunities to fix the problem.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
